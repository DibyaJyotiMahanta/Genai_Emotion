# Genai_Emotion
A Google Gen Ai based python script  which takes text input from user and decided the emotion of the text and tags the text.

### Key Features

- **Leverages Google Cloud Natural Language API:** Analyzes text to classify emotions like anger, sadness, shock, annoyance, embarrassment, and more.
- **Customizable with Training Data:** (Optional) Fine-tune the model with your client's specific training data for improved accuracy within their domain.

### Technologies

- Python (programming language)
- Google Colaboratory (cloud-based environment for training and execution)
- Kaggle (platform for downloading training datasets)

### Project Setup

1. **Create a Google Cloud Project:** Sign up for a free Google Cloud account and create a new project to access the Google Gen Ai API. Enable the API for your project. https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/python_quickstart
2. **Install Required Libraries:** In your Google Colab notebook, install the necessary libraries using `pip install`. Refer to the official Google Gen Ai API documentation for specific requirements.

1. **Download Dataset from Kaggle:** If your client provides training data, download it from Kaggle. Ensure the data is formatted appropriately for text analysis and emotion tagging (e.g., columns for text and corresponding emotion labels). You can use the Kaggle API with Python to automate the download process.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and pre-process the training data as needed. This might involve removing irrelevant information, handling missing values, converting text to lowercase, and potentially performing more advanced techniques like tokenization and stemming.

### Model Training and Usage (**Note:** This is a general outline. Refer to the Google Cloud Natural Language API documentation for specific implementation details.)

1. **Import Libraries:** Import the necessary libraries, including your authentication credentials for the Natural Language API.
2. **Define Function:** Create a function that takes text input, interacts with the Natural Language API, and returns the predicted emotions.
3. **Run Analysis:** Call the function with user input or test data to detect emotions and assign tags.


### Next Steps

- Integrate a user interface if you want to create a standalone app.
- Conduct thorough testing using various input scenarios.
- Continuously evaluate and improve the model's performance through retraining or incorporating user feedback.

### Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project by:

- Enhancing the code for training and analysis.
- Adding functionalities like user interface development.
- Implementing more advanced text preprocessing techniques.

### Disclaimer

- This is a general guide. Specific implementation will vary based on Google Gen Ai documentation and your project requirements.
- Consider potential costs associated with using the Google Cloud API (free tier limitations are available).
